/**
 * This class is used in {@link AggregateOperator} to support the aggregation operation for both SUM and AVG.
 * The output tuple of aggregation operation is split into two parts:
 *      (1) the name aggregation term are stored in {@code aggVarName}.
 *          they need to be updated when new tuples are grouped to existing tuples:
 *          for every new tuple that grouped to existing one:
 *          the aggregation value will be added to {@code aggSum},
 *          and the {@code aggCount} will be incremented by 1 for preparing for the AVG calculation
 *      (2) the other terms are stored in {@code termList}.
 *  After the aggregation process is completed,
 *  each instance of this class will be converted into an output tuple of {@link AggregateOperator}
 *  by calling {@link #getAvgTuple()} or {@link #getSumTuple()} depending on the use case.
